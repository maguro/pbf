/* OSM Binary file format

This is the master schema file of the OSM binary file format. This
file is designed to support limited random-access and future
extendability.

A binary OSM file consists of a sequence of FileBlocks (please see
fileformat.proto). The first fileblock contains a serialized instance
of HeaderBlock, followed by a sequence of PrimitiveBlock blocks that
contain the primitives.

Each primitiveblock is designed to be independently parsable. It
contains a string table storing all strings in that block (keys and
values in tags, roles in relations, usernames, etc.) as well as
metadata containing the precision of coordinates or timestamps in that
block.

A primitiveblock contains a sequence of primitive groups, each
containing primitives of the same type (nodes, densenodes, ways,
relations). Coordinates are stored in signed 64-bit integers. Lat&lon
are measured in units <granularity> nanodegrees. The default of
granularity of 100 nanodegrees corresponds to about 1cm on the ground,
and a full lat or lon fits into 32 bits.

Converting an integer to a lattitude or longitude uses the formula:
$OUT = IN * granularity / 10**9$. Many encoding schemes use delta
coding when representing nodes and relations.
